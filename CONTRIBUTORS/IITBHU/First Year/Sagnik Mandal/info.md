Hello Everyone,

I am Sagnik Mandal, a freshman at IIT (BHU) Varanasi, 

persuing a BTech-MTech (IDD) in Materials Science & Technology.

Github used to use the master terminology for all branches, but changes it after some people complained about Master - Slave terminology being socially inappropriate.

But Git still creates the default branch as master, so people who dont make a new repo from the web-interface, and rather use git init, have master as their main branch
